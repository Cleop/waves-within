        <p class="f5">
          The perceived prize is not there at the end of the dream.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          This may seem like a societal anti-pattern but it has to be lived to be understood. If you strive to become who you truly are,
          and commit to working towards this, you will be rewarded.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It’s to live the journey of life itself, and to understand that within that journey you’ll find reward in the process of learning
          and developing. It’s not writing for the purpose of having your views gratified or to have a book published. Goals are important,
          but they act simply as a beacon for your concentration, the process leading to that beacon is the prize.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          The joy really is in living the journey, failing, recovering, failing, recovering, rinse and repeat.
          The joy isn’t in removing all risk and adventure so we are ‘safe’. That is escaping the truth of reality, survival is
          ever-present, and we must continue to develop. Not developing so we can get likes and shares, but developing in a way of
          becoming who you truly are, pursuing things you really believe in, even if the end goal seems unachievable or not in line with
          societal expectations.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          This is the same kicker for me. I thought my writing will be the end goal that will bring me joy and peace. Instead, I
          realised that learning itself, needing not even to profess it to anyone but myself, is the reward. I don’t need to turn it
          into X or Y.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          I’m inward facing, not outward facing</br>
          I aim to resist my ego’s temptation for gratification</br>
          I aim to resist my ego’s need to change everyone and the world</br>
          I can only change myself, and that is enough</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          The world is imperfect</br>
          That is the design</br>
          I must accept this to truly understand</br>
          My longing to change people</br>
          Is simply an extension of my ego</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It’s accepting that things aren’t perfect</br>
          And thats ok</br>
          You can ask people the right questions</br>
          But you cannot live their journey</br>
          For them</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          I must remind myself</br>
          Not to act too timidly</br>
          Not to be fearful of making mistakes</br>
          Not to listen to other people above my own voice</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Making mistakes is where beauty lives</br>
          Beauty and pain often live hand-in-hand</br>
          It’s the way it is</br>
          Try to resist it</br>
          You will lose</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          The joy is in taking a step</br>
          In pushing forward</br>
          With what you always feared</br>
          But what about this?</br>
          But what about that?</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Choose to either take action</br>
          Or continue on this journey of numbness</br>
          Seeking highs to justify your decision</br>
          Deep down it will never stop knocking at your door</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Begin the process now</br>
          Rather than when you are about to die</br>
          For death can come knocking at anytime</br>
          Let it be the ultimate motivator</br>
