          You’re addicted to your smartphone. I’m addicted to my smartphone. The
          products and services we use on a daily basis have been designed to
          steal our attention and are continuously modified to become more
          addictive.

          there is a direct correlation between attention and growth/revenue/success.
          The recent evolution of technology raises many ethical and psychological
          questions. Are we being manipulated? Should we have more control? Do we
          truly understand the negative impacts of technology addiction?
