        <h2 class="mt4 f3 fw3 mb4 pb2 bb">We are all philosophers</h2>
        <p class="f5">
          Philosophy has become a dying, practical discipline and it's time we bring this back to life to help ourselves and the
          environment find balance and meaning.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Philosophy is about analysing our own experience, having the courage to ask why, and questioning existing structures and
          patterns that don’t make sense anymore. I must emphasise the word courage, because without this, there is no progress.
          We have become accepting of what we are told, of what happens to us and what we are given, regardless if it serves us well or not.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It is using our own ‘unique’ perspectives to come up with new ideas and ways of thinking, it’s massively creative and is at the
          same time therapeutic. It builds strength inside of us, it allows us to take responsibility for our own lives rather than
          pointing the finger at others.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Philosophy should not be contextless, it should not be asking questions for the sake of asking a question or just to pass an exam,
          but rather because something doesn’t seem right, needs updating or is not serving its intended purpose. It helps us understand
          ourselves and our lives better, it develops meaning. Philosophy is not only for the ‘educated’ and ‘wealthy’, over the years
          it has become something that we think needs a degree or a qualification, this is a lie.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Philosophy worships experience, practicality and then reflection, it is learn by doing, not by theory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="f4 fw3">EXAMPLES INCLUDE</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          - Why do we check our phones so many times a day?</br>
          - Why do I watch so much TV?</br>
          - Why do we keep buying things and changing them so often?</br>
          - Why did I lack so much interest at school?</br>
          - Why do I need to be in this meeting?</br>
          - Why do I struggle to be around a certain person?</br>
          - Why do I drink so much coffee?
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Society lives behind a veil of pacifism, pretending that life is hunky-dory and that we are not living our own adventures,
          our own battles. If we share our struggles and our successes, so many others can learn and build on them and find peace
          knowing we are not alone in this journey.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Our conversations don’t tend to go beyond the surface level, our emotional intelligence is dwindling because we lack the
          courage to be honest, this is what we need to bring back, honest conversation about the struggles we are facing, rather than
          trying to pretend that life is ‘good all the time’, and anything deviating from that is taboo.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          We should be prepared to be right and wrong, but also understand these always change, new ideas, new evidence is always
          present, you are not always right and nor am I.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Someone who works as a gardener can often different viewpoints to someone who works as a lawyer. Someone who lives on a
          council estate can offer different viewpoints to someone who lives in a gated community. It is the diversity of opinion and
          experience that allows us to make levelled decisions. Otherwise, we will continue on this path of separation.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Neuroscience provides evidence that we don’t see ‘reality’, we see our version of events, the meaning we have attached to an
          objective experience.
          Therefore how can we expect to have a more balanced society when we don’t open our eyes to other experiences and meanings
          outside of what we usually encounter.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It also shows that our brains follow a train track method, so when we have experiences and make judgements of these
          experiences, it can be very hard to change them as they become hard wired, to protect energy for survival. You can change them
          by asking questions and understanding the misconceptions of the mind.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          For more detail on neuroscience and how our minds really work, read a fantastic book by Beau Lotto called Deviate.
