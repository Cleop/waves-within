        <p class="f5">
          I wanted to highlight music that has provided me energy, inspiration,
          healing and peace throughout my journey of self-discovery. There is
          something for whatever mood or period I am going through in my life,
          this is music that connects to an individual on a deeper level.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
           I’ve grouped them into sections and explained when they come of use
           to me. It’s worth mentioning that I mostly listen to this music
           alone. Hope you find something interesting.
        </p>
        <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR SLOWING DOWN</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This is music for general relaxing and dissolving. This is the sort of music to listen to on a lazy day,
          wrapped up in a blanket on the sofa with your favourite drink, and a nice window to stare out of. Feel
          your muscles exhale. Words associated would be peace, relaxation and letting go.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR NATURE</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This music is about the wonderment of nature, the magic and mystery and understanding that perceived
          ‘normality' is beautiful beyond measure, if we dare to be still and see what’s in front of our eyes.
          Words associated are adventure, reverence, reflection, spiritualism and magic.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR CREATIVE ENDEAVOUR</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This is music to listen to when new ideas are arising and the feeling that something needs to rise to
          the surface. Accompany this music by having a pen and paper handy, writing down key words that come to
          your head and don't concern yourself with the context just yet. Words associated would be playful, discovery,
          innocence, ideation, freedom and visionary.

        <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR DEEP MEDITATIONS</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This is music used to surrender to the spirit, to enter into the void, a place of absolute stillness
          and to connect to the energy around us. Feel as if you have dissolved into the earth, it is often a place
          of healing. Begin this process by meditating to reconnect with awareness. Associated words would be stillness,
          healing, spiritualism, medicine, native cultures, transitions and mysticism.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR GRATEFULNESS</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This is music to listen to for times of reflection and to be thankful for what we have in our lives and what we have
          experienced. Give yourself the space to ponder mentally when listening to this music, to be calm and still. Words
          associated would be grateful, reflective, surrender and inspiring.
        </p>

         <h3 class="f4 fw3">FOR PRAYER</h3>
         <p class="f5">
          This is music to listen to when you feel like formally praying. Religion agnostic, it’s about the practice and
          chanting that is uplifting and hypnotic. No labels. Words associated would be stillness, rhythmic and chanting.
