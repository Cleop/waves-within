        <h3 class="f4 fw3"></h3>
        <p class="f5">
          Peace and contentment live within the rhythm of nature.<br/>
          Nature oscillates at the right frequency. We often do not<br/>
          To seek peace, observe nature, and understand it’s teachings<br/>
          Look beyond what you see.<br/>
          It surrounds us at all times, we just resist it, and that resistance may lead to disease<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Nature abides by the seasons, it does not force itself to flower all year round.<br/>
          It knows that there are times to hibernate, to gather energy, to become slower, as well as times to stand up tall and show all
          of it’s colours.<br/>
          It accepts death and sews its seed knowing rebirth will follow, it always does.<br/>
          Nature does not rush, it takes it time to rise from the earth and form it’s roots.<br/>
          It knows that rising too fast, will mean it will
          not stand strong so it waits patiently.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Nature understands balance<br/>
          Balance of energies<br/>
          Balance of growth<br/>
          Balance of cycles<br/>
          It does not try to fight against this<br/>
          It yields<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It knows if it consumes too much or too little, it jeopardises its health, and those around it<br/>
          It knows if it doesn’t rest enough or too much, it won’t have enough energy to keep growing or it will kill itself<br/>
          It knows this is a ongoing battle, that it must stay in rhythm<br/>
          In that rhythm, things feel right<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Nature accepts it’s spectrum<br/>
          It understands that there are times when it needs to fight, times to rest<br/>
          It knows that it must stay sharp<br/>
          But this is not the focus, it’s a tool for it to use<br/>
          The focus is to find balance, to find peace, to find it’s place<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It accepts change<br/>
          Change in the weather, change in circumstances<br/>
          No water, too much water, it adapts<br/>
          It knows that things will change again, that the sun will shine and one day the water will follow<br/>
          It persists, it’s resilient<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It remains humble<br/>
          It knows that the flowers will die but the trees will remain strong<br/>
          It does not need to show it’s strength, it builds itself slowly and without pretension, moving anything in it’s way with a
          slow, patient force<br/>
          It remains humble but strong, it uses only what it needs to, but accepts that life is a battle, it’s not a conclusion<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It accepts the rough weather and the smooth<br/>
          It does not wish for either<br/>
          It knows it will break at some point but that it will recover, that it will never stay as it is<br/>
          It’s strong enough to stand alone when required<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It grows in the rough and releases in the smooth<br/>
          It ponders, it looks around without making a sound.<br/>
          It does not need to be distracted, there is more than enough to see<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          It understands that it’s part of the whole, that it needs the bees to pollenate, the sun to shine, the water to drink<br/>
          It does not destroy it’s very lifeline<br/>
          It’s invisible to most eyes, subtle, yet the most powerful force on the planet<br/>
          It will destroy us if we dare to think we stand above it<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Ask yourself, how in line with nature are you?<br/>
          How often do you accept change?<br/>
          How often do you let parts of you die and rebirth into something new?<br/>
          How often do you work quietly, without pretension?<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          If you want to find peace, it’s very simple<br/>
          We are all vibrating to this frequency<br/>
          But humans seem to think we are exempt<br/>
          Adopt the laws of nature<br/>
          And you will find peace<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          The first step is to ask why<br/>
          Study nature, what patterns does it follow<br/>
          Question everything you’ve been told<br/>
          This is tough<br/>
          It takes patience, resilience and determination<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          We’ve been taught the opposite<br/>
          That we can control nature<br/>
          That we are above it<br/>
          We are destroying our own back yard<br/>
          We are destroying ourselves<br/>
          When will we see this?<br/>

        <h3 class="f4 fw3">REFLECTIONS ON MY JOURNEY</h3>
        <p class="f5">
          This article was written after reflecting on my journey with anxiety and panic. Throughout my mid-late 20’s, I had felt like
          I was flying in my career and life in general. I had so much energy, loved living in the city and felt I had purpose.
          But circumstances changed a few years later, things that used to make me happy no longer did, I didn’t get the same warmth from
          what I was doing or from where I lived.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          As I wasn’t prepared to accept the change, I chose to ignored the internal shift of frequency and distract myself, trying to
          make more money or find something more shiny. The more I did this, the more I ignored the rhythm, the more I fell into
          disease. Heart problems, burn-out, anxiety and panic ensued until I hit the point where I could not go on any more.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          I went into hibernation, into retreat, I spent a winter unpacking what had happened, resting, being in nature, meditating and
          doing simple things. Without knowing, I began following my natural internal rhythm, not forcing myself to ‘be something’. This
          took an enormous amount of faith, in a world where the default is to pretend everything is OK and that we always stay the same
          throughout our whole lives. I was confronting my ego that was saying ‘why aren’t you doing X or Y?’.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          What you learn during the emergence from darkness, equips you to flourish in the light. Neither state is preferred, both are
          cherished. Even though there is pain in the darkness, there is also beauty because what develops is a renewed sense of self,
          full of new ideas and invigoration. I have come to accept the cycles of change that nature teaches us, my resistance to them is
          what caused the suffering, not the change themselves. By being patient, which was terribly hard, I began to recover, ever so
          slowly.  I slept better, I had more energy, I could look forward again.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          I took 4 steps forward, 2 steps back, but I persisted. I bare the scars but do not fear them being seen.
          I learnt to say no, that there is a limit, that I have a balance to upkeep and the more I deviate from that, the more I
          deviate from peace.
          I let the old me die, and ushered in the new. I understood that I am always subject to change, that I have to adapt, that life
          is a battle, that there is no feeling ‘good’ all the time, but accepting that the way is to be comfortable with however I feel,
          not labelling it.
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          You don’t serve anyone by keeping things quiet, open up. We are all going through similar things.
