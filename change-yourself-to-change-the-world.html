        <p class="f5">
          There are many people on this planet<br/>
          Who will be doing things that are heroic<br/>
          Who will reach the end of their lives<br/>
          Without many people knowing their impact<br/>
          Acting in silence<br/>
          Does that make them any less important than those we heroify?<br/>
          Does that make you and your endeavours any less important?<br/>
          Is it right that the barometer of success is often public opinion?<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Be aware of the hero complex<br/>
          Often, we are willing to sacrifice everything to become a hero<br/>
          But at what expense?<br/>
          And how much of this is egoic endeavour?<br/>
          The more we live out of balance to achieve certain goals<br/>
          The more we sacrifice long term<br/>
          Creating an unbalanced planet<br/>
          Put simply, our planet is an amalgamation of global society in the present moment<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          In extreme cases, there is no choice but to live out of balance<br/>
          How many of us avoid looking inward, avoid the greatest challenge, learning about oneself<br/>
          To instead find egoic gratification through external achievements<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          But I hear you say<br/>
          The world isn’t going to fix itself<br/>
          Who else is going to do it?<br/>
          I understand, I thought like that for most of my life<br/>
          But I realised, it was at the expense of myself and of my loved ones<br/>
          In the process of trying to help others, I was hurting others because I was hurting myself<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          If you look inward<br/>
          You will begin the journey to finding peace within yourself<br/>
          You will then emanate this peace to others<br/>
          You will find peace in your own world, even amongst chaos<br/>
          Which if we all practiced, would change the world<br/>
          One small invisible step at a time<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          This is the hardest challenge<br/>
          Because we are fearful of what lies within<br/>
          We don’t understand ourselves and have destroyed our natural intuition<br/>
          So we seek external praise for self satisfaction<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          We can all be impactful if we choose to change ourselves first<br/>
          The world is the sum total of us all<br/>
          Change yourself and the world changes with it<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
          Choose acceptance, choose awareness, seek simplicity<br/>
          Question things don’t make sense, things that aren’t right<br/>
          Gather courage to seek the greatest journey, the pursuit of self realisation<br/>
          Our trueselves is enough, we just need to realise it<br/>
