        <p class="f5">
        Put simply, you can and must create experiences that change your identity.</br>
        As your identity changes, your future will change.</br>
        “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.”</br>
        Change can only happen by imagining a different world, and then courageously seeking new and expansive experiences.</br>
        Change happens as you learn and expand your world.</br>
        ALBERT EINSTEIN
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        Long term goals, do not be concerned with the day-to-day, let that flow.</br>
        Have the courage to know when to stop.</br>
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        "After you have exhausted what there is in business, politics, conviviality,</br>
        and so on - have found that none of these finally
        satisfy, or permanently wear</br>
        - what remains? Nature remains." </br>
        WALT WHITMAN
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        "To be admitted to Nature's hearth costs nothing.</br>
        None is excluded, but excludes himself.</br>
        You have only to push aside the curtain."</br>
        HENRY DAVID THOREAU
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        "You become most powerful in whatever you do if the action is performed for it's own sake</br>
        rather than as a means to protect, enhance, or confirm to your role identity"</br>
        MARCUS AURELIUS
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        "He who looks the higher is the more highly distinguished,</br>
        and turning over the great book of nature</br>
        which is the proper object of philosophy</br>
        is the way to elevate one's gaze.</br>
        GALILEO
        </p>
        <p class="f5">
        "Be not the slave of your own past – plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep, and swim far,</br>
        so you shall come back with new self-respect, with new power,</br>
        and with an advanced experience that shall explain and overlook the old.”</br>
